# jquery.caro - Simple, scaleable carousel for jQuery

Why we need yet another carousel plugin? Simply because I couldn't find one that fits my purposes. As a result caro.js was born. It does one thing better than the others, it scales according to your layout.

It is very basic by design. You'll likely need to spice it up with some CSS magic to suit your purposes. The core logic is there, though.
